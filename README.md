# OfficeMacro64
This is a 64 bit VBA implementation of Christophe Tafani-Dereeper's original VBA code described in his blog @ https://blog.christophetd.fr/building-an-office-macro-to-spoof-process-parent-and-command-line/


I was on a red team engagement and found out the client uses 64-bit version of Office 2016. Had to quickly modify Christophe's code @  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophetd/spoofing-office-macro/master/macro.vba
